## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ‚ùì

### What is a passphrase?

A passphrase is a sequence of words or a phrase used to secure access to something, like an account or a device. It is generally longer than a password and can be easier to remember.

### Why use a passphrase generator?

Using a passphrase generator ensures that you create strong, unique passphrases that are difficult to guess. It reduces the risk of using weak or repeated passwords across different accounts.

### Can I use Phrase.it.com offline?

Yes, once you download the files and run them locally, you can use the generator without an internet connection.

### Is my data safe?

Since Phrase.it.com runs entirely in your browser and does not send any data to external servers, your generated passphrases remain private.

## Acknowledgments üôè

We would like to thank the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for their work on the short word list, which is the foundation of our passphrase generation.
